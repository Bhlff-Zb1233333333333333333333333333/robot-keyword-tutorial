# Robot Framework - Keyword Tutorial

The main idea of this project is to have easy and out-of-the-box working examples how to work with the [Robot Framework](http://www.robotframework.org). And here especially with its most central feature, namely, _Keywords_.

Therefore the tutorial is splitted into really small sections and is always only using those _Keywords_ that are part of the Robot Framework out-of-the-box. Thus no additional installation is required beside having a running _Robot Framework_ installation and forking/cloning this repository to try around with the examples.
